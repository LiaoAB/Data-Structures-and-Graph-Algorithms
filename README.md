# Data-Structures-and-Graph-Algorithms
## 1-Date-Data-Type
*Implement a new data type, called date.
  1. Input (initialize the date)
    Provide at least yyyy/mm/dd as input.
  2. Output (convert the date to string)
    In addition to yyyy/mm/dd, generate at least MonthName dd, yyyy as output, where MonthName is the name of the moth January, February, . . . , December.
  3. Operations
    Implement the following operations:
    
    1. DayOfWeek(date)
        Return day of the week: Sunday, Monday, . . . Saturday.
        
    2. DateSub(date1, date2)
        Return number of days from date1 to date2.
        
    3. DateAdd(date, n)
        Return the date which is n days after date.
## 2-Sorting
*Implement the following sorting algorithms and compare their performances.

  1. Insertion sort

  2. Selection sort

  3. Quick sort

  4. Merge sort

  5. Heap sort
## 3-Shortest-Path-in-a-Maze
*Design and implement efficient data structure and algorithm for finding shortest path from the start cell s to the destination cell t in a maze of dimension m × n.
## 4-Sparse-Matrix
*Implement appropriate data structures to support efficient operations on sparse matrices. The operations should at least include addition (subtraction) and multiplication of matrices.
## 5-Evaluation-of-Arithmetic-Expression
*Design and implement efficient data structure and algorithm for the evaluation of arithmetic expressions and assignment statement.
## 6-Segment-Tree
*Design and implement efficient data structure and algorithm for finding the maximum elements in given interval in given data. There are two part in this assignment. First design a data structure with size O (n) and an algorithm to construct the data structure in linear time. Then, design an O (log n) time algorithm to process each query using the data structure.
## 7-Huffman-Code
*Design and implement efficient data structure and algorithm for computing Huffman code for each symbol in the input file. Then compress the input file, print out the compression ratio, and decode the encoded file.
## 8-Minimum-Spanning-Tree
*Design and implement efficient data structure and algorithm for computing minimum spanning tree of a weighted graph. Kruskal’s algorithm and disjoint set data structure are preferred in this assignment.
## 9-Shortest-Path
*Design and implement efficient data structure and algorithm for computing shortest path from the source vertex s to destination vertex t in a weighted graph. Dijkstra’s algorithm and priority queue data structure is preferred in this assignment.
