# Data-Structures-and-Graph-Algorithms
## 1-Date-Data-Type
*Implement a new data type, called date.
  1. Input (initialize the date)
    Provide at least yyyy/mm/dd as input.
  2. Output (convert the date to string)
    In addition to yyyy/mm/dd, generate at least MonthName dd, yyyy as output, where MonthName is the name of the moth January, February, . . . , December.
  3. Operations
    Implement at least the following operations:/n
    (a) DayOfWeek(date)
        Return day of the week: Sunday, Monday, . . . Saturday.
    (b) DateSub(date1, date2)
        Return number of days from date1 to date2.
    (c) DateAdd(date, n)
        Return the date which is n days after date.
## 2-Sorting
*Implement the following sorting algorithms and compare their performances.
  1. Insertion sort
  2. Selection sort
  3. Quick sort
  4. Merge sort
  5. Heap sort
## 3-Shortest-Path-in-a-Maze
*Design and implement efficient data structure and algorithm for finding shortest path from the start cell s to the destination cell t in a maze of dimension m Ã— n.
## 4-Sparse-Matrix
*Implement appropriate data structures to support efficient operations on sparse matrices. The operations should at least include addition (subtraction) and multiplication of matrices.
